# Docker_Flask
A dockerised Flask/Apache instance complete with WSGI configuration
Partially based on https://github.com/carlostighe/apache-flask, but modified for Python 3 and mod_WSGI use

TODO:
Figure out support for Let's Encrypt
Create docker volume for static HTML files for frontend development, so that changes can be reflected instantly and not mandate a docker stop-start procedure
